# Bare-Metal LLM OS Roadmap

This file tracks the progress of our bare-metal OS focused on running an LLM for chat purposes.

## Core OS Components

- [x] VGA Buffer for text output
- [x] Basic panic handler
- [x] Memory management
  - [x] Page table setup
  - [x] Heap allocation
- [x] Keyboard input handler ✅
- [ ] Interrupts
  - [ ] GDT (Global Descriptor Table)
  - [ ] IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table)
  - [ ] Hardware interrupt handling

## LLM Implementation

- [x] Simple model representation
- [ ] Tokenization
- [x] Inference engine
  - [x] Forward pass
  - [x] Context management
- [x] Response generation

## Chat Interface

- [x] Command line interface
- [x] User input handling ✅
- [x] Response display
- [x] Chat history management

## Optimizations

- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Quantized model implementation (4-bit or 8-bit)
- [ ] Efficient inference algorithms

## Advanced Features

- [ ] Persistent storage for chat history
- [ ] Model weight loading from storage
- [ ] Custom prompt templates
- [x] System commands (/help, /clear, etc.)
- [x] Performance metrics display

## Current Development Status

**Current stage**: Working LLM Chat Interface ✅

**Next steps**:
1. ✅ Fixed build system issues
2. ✅ Completed memory management implementation
3. ✅ Implemented keyboard handling with proper backspace support
4. ✅ Created simple LLM simulator
5. ✅ Developed chat interface
6. Add interrupt handling for better keyboard input
7. Enhance LLM implementation with more advanced features

**Long-term goals**:
1. Create a fully functional, efficient LLM that can run on bare metal
2. Optimize for minimal resource usage
3. Develop a friendly and responsive chat interface
