# Main Entry Point (main.rs)

## Overview
The `main.rs` file serves as the entry point for this bare metal OS. It's a "no_std" Rust application, meaning it runs without the standard library, making it suitable for OS development.

## Key Components
- Uses the `bootloader` crate for system initialization
- Implements panic and allocation error handlers
- Coordinates initialization of various subsystems:
  - Memory management
  - Heap allocation
  - Keyboard input
  - VGA buffer output
  - Chat interface

## Features
- Custom test framework support
- x86 interrupt handling
- Custom allocator implementation
- Bare metal LLM (Language Model) integration

## Initialization Flow
1. Boot info processing
2. Physical memory mapping
3. Heap initialization
4. Keyboard subsystem setup
5. Chat interface startup

## Improvement Possibilities
1. Add multi-threading support
2. Implement device drivers for more hardware
3. Add filesystem support
4. Implement networking stack
5. Add proper shutdown sequence
6. Implement power management
7. Add user authentication
8. Improve error handling and recovery
